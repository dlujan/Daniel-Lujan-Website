# I'm Gonna Sell Banana Bread
That's right. I'm starting a new business venture. I'm selling my banana bread! In this article I'm going to explain my plans, how I'm doing it, and what my goals are. My eventual goal is to be able to look back at each of my steps and compile them into a guide that anyone can follow to in order to recreate what I've done. Let's get bakin'.

## Step 1 - Have A Great Product
The first thing I've learned is that in order to start a baking business, you need a great product that you love. Mine is my banana bread that I've been baking for years! You can ask any of my friends and family but I'm pretty much obsessed with my banana bread and I think it's so good. I'm always saying how I need to share it with the world and how I could totally sell this bread.

This leads me to my first realization. In order for this to work at all I need to a have a great product and I need to enjoy making it. Another thing is to validate your product with friends and family. Do just you think it's good or do multiple other people think it's good, because that's what you need. If you and at least 3 other people think your bread or whatever you're making is delicious, you're good to start selling. This leads me to my next point.

## Step 2 - Making My First Sale
You've verified that your product is yummy. Now it's time to get your business started. Make your first sale! First step to make your business look legit; create a website. I used [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) to create a simple, quick, and free website for my banana bread business. If it's still up you can view it [here](https://daniels-banana-bread.carrd.co/). You just need a nice looking place on the web to direct potential customers and talk a bit about your product.

The next thing I did after setting up this site in 5 minutes was use [this free QR code generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) to print QR codes that direct to my website. I then printed these out and literally taped them around my apartment complex. After a couple of days my first customer reached out to me by email wanting a loaf! A couple days later after some banana ripening time, I whipped up her loaf and delivered it to her myself. Boom first transaction.

## Closing
That's about it for now. In my next post I'll talk about the next steps I'll take to further this new business. But to sum it up for now:
- Have a great product
- Create a free website with Carrd
- Get your first customer (word of mouth or QR code prints)
- Deliver it yourself and make that first transaction

Also make sure to review the Cottage Food Laws in your state since I'm assuming you're baking in your home, like I am. That will be very important to go over for yourself. For example, eventually you will need to label your food for allergies and such, but that's out of the scope of this article. I'm going to get into that in coming posts. We just want to make our first under-the-table sale and start getting the word out and getting momentum!

See you soon!
